**#RowTranspositionEncryption** (H2)
After executing the code it takes 2 inputs(both strings). one is a plain text which needs to be encrypted and second is a key used for encryption. Once the code is executed, enter plain text in console which needs to be encrypted and press enter and then enter the key with which it need to encrypt. Then the obtained output is the encrypted text which is cipher text.

**#RowTranspositionDecryption** (H3)
After executing the code it takes 2 inputs(both strings). one is a cipher text which should be decrypted  and second is a key used to decrypt the cipher text to plain text. Once the code is executed, enter a cipher text in console and press enter and then enter the key with which it need to decrypt. Then the obtained output is the plain text i.e, decrypted text.
